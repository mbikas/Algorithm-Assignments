Idea of the polynomial time algorithm for finding the maximum clique in an interval graph:
1. Sorting the graph based on the their start point
2. Calculating the maximum clique for each node by comparing with all other nodes end points with current nodes start point

Algorithm:
rerurn maximum Clique of an interval graph
MamimumClique( G(V,E),N)
//G in the interval Graph
//N is the total number of nodes
-----------------------
1. Sort the noded based on their start points
2. maxClique <- 1		//if input have only one point
3. for i=1 to N-1		//N : no of  nodes in the interval graph
		clique = 1;
		for j= i to 0
			if (G[j].y >= G[i+1].x)
				clique <- clique +1;	
		if (clique > maxClique)
			maxClique <- clique;
4. return maxClique
